# Machine-Learning-Python

This project is a lab implemented by IBM, authored by Saeed Aghabozorgi, with documentation by Masoud Salehi. Â© IBM Corporation 2020.

## Overview

This project focuses on implementing recommendation systems using two methods: Collaborative Filtering (User-Based) and Content-Based. 

## DataSets

There are two datasets in this project:
- One for ratings
- One for movies

## Objective

The objective of this project is to create a sample user who has seen and rated some movies and recommend new movies to them based on their preferences.

## Implementation Details

### Collaborative Filtering (User-Based)

In this method, recommendations are made based on the similarity of users' preferences. We'll explore this concept with examples before diving into the implementation.

### Content-Based

Content-based recommendation systems suggest items similar to those a user has liked in the past. Again, we'll provide examples to illustrate this method before discussing the implementation details.

## Documentation

Parts of the code have been documented to aid in understanding the implementation process.
